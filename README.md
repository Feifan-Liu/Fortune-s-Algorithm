Fortune's Algorithm

Fortune's algorithm is a sweep line algorithm for generating a Voronoi diagram from a set of points in a plane using O(n log n) time and O(n) space. In this project, we build a web applet utilizing Fortuneâ€™s algorithm and visualized each step of which. Detailed instructions can be found on the webpage.
