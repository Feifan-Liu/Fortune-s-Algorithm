Fortune's Algorithm
Fortune's algorithm is a sweep line algorithm for generating a Voronoi diagram from a set of points in a plane using O(n log n) time and O(n) space. In this project, we build a web applet utilizing Fortune’s algorithm and visualized each step of which. Detailed instructions can be found on the webpage.
Please run command node server.js first under the “Fortunesalg” directory then visit url http://localhost:3000/
